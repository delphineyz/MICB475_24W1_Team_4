## Agenda
- go over proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPhxUpt52aT2B73raRDry57m03_jL8u9F3de8CUpVRM/edit?usp=sharing
- how do the README.md or R Scripts files work, do we put everything we work on there?
- directions for next steps

## Meeting Minutes
- should hear back next week for the proposal
- review marked proposal and come up with questions for the next meeting
- we should start with our data analysis
- start writing methods and results for each aim
- assign people for each aim to do the analysis
  - more complex analysis should have more people assigned
- learning how to use ANCOM will require more work and energy, so we should be aware of that
  - can give it a shot, and if it doesn't work out, then we can use DeSEQ2 and can use DeSEQ2 as a comparison
- look at UJEMI papers from last year and look at their GitHub's to determine what we need to add to our GitHub
- have all your data and results out by December 1 as a minimum (figures completed)
  - ideally, we should have more work done by then due to the presentation happening on Dec 2
- sit down and on a piece of paper and determine exactly what kind of data and plots we need in our figure (we should know exactly what our figures should look like)
  - draw fake axis and what our data should look like
  - can look at past papers to determine what our figures need to look like
  - ANCOM may not be in past UJEMI papers so we can look for papers outside of UJEMI that includes that (not limited to only doing what was done in past papers)
- we can resubmit all written assignments (including research proposals) and we can talk about this next meeting
- for the proposed approach, we can describe each sentence in detail

Action items:
- finish aim 1 and aim 2 if possible
- think about each figure (and panels) and how the layout will look in detail
