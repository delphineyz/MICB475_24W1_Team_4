# Oct 3. - Second Meeting

## Agenda: 
- update from Evelyn on the Alzheimer's dataset
- get advice from the teaching team on our current ideas:

PD/Alzheimer's (?) Dataset
1) Does sleep deprivation and its effect on glucose levels impact microbiome diversity within PD patients?
2) Is IBS/constipation associated with microbiome diversity within PD and Alzheimerâ€™s? 
3) How does the diveristy of the microbiome compare between PD and Alzheimer's Patients?

Back-up Dataset ISS:
1) How to access ISS dataset?
2) We have some ideas of questions, but finding it difficult to determine if our questions are novel enough.
   
Back-up Dataset MS:
1) Is there a specific allergen that makes the microbiome conducive for MS?
2) Does living on a farm make the microbiome more conducive for disease?

- ask about logistics and delegating tasks
- feedback on determining a question/potential AIMS and future directions (e.g. creating a timeline, etc.)
