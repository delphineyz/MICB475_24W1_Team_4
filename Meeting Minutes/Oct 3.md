# Oct 3. - Second Meeting

## Agenda: 
- update from Evelyn on the Alzheimer's dataset
- get advice from the teaching team on our current ideas:

PD/Alzheimer's (?) Dataset
1) Does sleep deprivation and its effect on glucose levels impact microbiome diversity within PD patients?
2) Is IBS/constipation associated with microbiome diversity within PD and Alzheimerâ€™s? 
3) How does the diveristy of the microbiome compare between PD and Alzheimer's Patients?

Back-up Dataset ISS:
1) How to access ISS dataset?
2) We have some ideas of questions, but finding it difficult to determine if our questions are novel enough.
   
Back-up Dataset MS:
1) Is there a specific allergen that makes the microbiome conducive for MS?
2) Does living on a farm make the microbiome more conducive for disease?

- ask about logistics and delegating tasks
- feedback on determining a question/potential AIMS and future directions (e.g. creating a timeline, etc.) 

## Meeting Minutes

Update on Alzheimer's dataset:
- Alzheimer's dataset will likely take too long to get access too

ISS dataset:
- choose either a longitudinal or functional direction with the ISS dataset question
- use relative humidity dataset if they have internal vs external dataset
   - https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-694
- previous paper
   - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11386075/
- repeat taxa bar plot analysis at different resolution levels
- looking at the functional side of the previous paper
- functional vs taxonomic:
   - taxonomic: looking at what bacteria exist in certain areas
   - functional: how those bacteria behave with metabolic pathways (predictive)
      - may need to use PICRUSt
- different species associated with different moisture levels
- bin into different bins for humidity (high, mid, low)
   - find standards or look at the sample and cut it off based on proportions of samples
- Evelyn will send a metadata file to our group
- 

Delegating task/logistics:
- team server for QIIME
- Hans will advise on R-related activities

Goals for next week:
- start to define our research question and aims
- start working towards outlining our proposal
  
- Considering ISS dataset and/or other NASA datasets
- [Dataset](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-694), [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11386075/), [metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sYFWApS3anfyT-_HLJm6b2PJkU3hfb5Nj5fkB-dlImw/edit?gid=771785112#gid=771785112)
- Research question:
