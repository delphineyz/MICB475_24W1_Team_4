## Agenda
- show our new proposal
- advice for next steps
- decide/finalize which graphs we will be using
- give tasks for analysis
    - tentative: alpha diversity on R (delphine), beta diversity on R (simran), ANCOM (bhav), indicator species/core microbiome (parsa), picrust2 (jagroop), deseq2 (delphine)
 
## Meeting Minutes
- download all of the qza files and other files from QIIME just in case it crashes
- finish all the data and stuff by Nov. 21
- maybe finish data stuff before reading break is done
- atleast half of AIMs done by Nov 14th, and almost all done by the 21st!

- don't forget to put code and data and everything we work on in Manuscript folder of the GitHub
- put the code for each figures in each of their specific folders
- maybe type the results and figure legend in the README.md
- when to reach out to Hans as well:
    - email Hans at any point and try and give him a day (smaller things) or two days (for larger files)

 ## Action Items:
  - Jagroop get us update QIIME files
  - Bhavya start alpha/beta diversity wtih Simran -> use more diversity metrics than just Shannon's diversity index and Bray-Crutis in order to perform testing
  - Delphine begin DEseq2 and ANCOM (if time permits) -> can represent the DEseq2 as an bar plot showing the log-fold 2 change 
  - Parsa start indicator species and core microbiome analysis
  - Jagroop begin PICRust 2 analysis -> can show analysis as a heat map
