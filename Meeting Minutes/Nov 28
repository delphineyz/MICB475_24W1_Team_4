## Meeting Minutes
- too much on slides
- title should reflect our finding
- new title: increase in humidity affects microbial composition in space dust samples on the ISS?
- more visuals
- can cut down on methodology
- make aims bigger
- can remove slides 6-9
- how are we transitions from our background to our research objectives (why are we doing this)(this is background, this is what we dont know, and this is what were doing)
- find a consistent theme across all of the slides (can have ubc background, a white box on top of that to make a ubc border)
- pick one for alpha and beta diversity graph
- figure legends never in presentation
- slide title should be a biological conclusion for the presentation slides where we are presenting our data
- keep ns in graphs
- dont have more than 12-14 slides
- make the 4 aims into one slide
- only provide an overview of methods if we include
- for aim 1, just do one alpha and one beta and that there is no difference between the two (no need for taxa bar plot)
- dont mention constant vs varying humidity (take out aim 1 for presentation, include in supplemental and methods for manuscript)
- for aim 2, most interesting is chao and observed but shannon and observed is most common (this is figure 1 for our manuscript) (pick shannon and observed)
- dont include taxa bar plot in presentation or in manuscript (if we mention in our discussion it can be a supplemental figure)
- make general slide with aims and then show conclusion for that aim and how it feeds into our next aim
- we can list the appraoches/methodology that we did and what we found (we can pretty much just do through the figures and be like our approach was x and we found y)
- aim 3: have taxon as column
- figure 1 is alpha beta diversity for high low medium, fig 2 is core microbiome include panel a and b, fig 3 is deseq with volcana plot and bar plots, fig 4 is network analysis is 6 panels with low at top and medium in bottom with the same order
- s1 alpha and beta is for crh and vrh, s2 taxa bar plot?
- for network analysis mention what nodes, what lines are and how theyre created
- send hans slides on monday so that he can take a look and provide feedback before presentation (can hop on a zoom if needed)
