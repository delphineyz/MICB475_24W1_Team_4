# September 26 - First Meeting
Discussing possible ideas.

## Provided datasets: 
ISS: Compare ISS microbiota surfaces to microbiota of astronauts. Compare which bacteria survive and what that means for life forms and implications of survival in an artificial environments. Could potentially tell us about survival of bacteria, pathogenic ones and how it transmits. \
Diabetes (Texas): Compare the differences of the gut microbiome between the Texas Cohort and Mexican cohort to determine the role that the gut microbiome plays in causing diabetes \
MS: Compare differences in gut microbiome among patients who used different NSAIDs. 

## External datasets: 
Comparing PD and AD dataset (external, PMID: 35275538) from Finlay Lab. \
Comparing PD across different countries (Eastern vs. Western)
