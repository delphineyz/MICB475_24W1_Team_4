## Agenda
- review updated figures/graphs
- Jagroop, obtain help with PICRUST?
  
## Meeting
- bhav described what the project is about
- found that high humidity had a significantly lower alpha diversity as compared to low and medium
  - high humidity wasn't the most comparable in terms of beta diversity

  AIM 1
- we can keep things at phylum level
- for figure C, which we should change to figure D, we should make sure the labels are the same size; also make the font bigger; also make sure that the graph is going downwards

  AIM 2
- significant between high and low/medium
- move the asteriks down so it's closer to the red box
- what's driving the differences is probably the species because the observerd as compared to the Shannon diversity is the biggest difference?
- figure C, the high has a bigger amount of one phylum
- the higher humidity is too high so it may become more stressful for most species?
- figure A: change the placement of the legend (low, medium, high things)
   - reorder the x-axis so it's low, medium, or high
- figure B, label the perctange variance of the axis
- figure C, add or remove black borders so it's similar to figure (D)

  AIM 3
- core microbiome analsysis, most of our samples fall into the middle ground and share more
- triangle graph (bhav explained)
- for figure C, it's not the best way we show indicator species, INSTEAD we should present it as a table
- we should see the table to see the indicator values
- go back to the indicator table and BLAST what the chloroplast one is
- figure D, DeSEQ with low humidity as the reference | figure e: flip the label so it's "high vs low" and "medium vs low"
- figure e, we should see a decrease in abundance?
- figure e, weird and cool error bars
- figure g/j: the colours are set differentlty
  -  looks like there's increased interactions for the .... humidity levels
- figure k: has more increased interactions in medium humidity levels as compared to low humiditiy levels

For Manuscript Writing:
- maybe relate it to the gut microbiome
  - we have a lot of microbes that are found in the gut so maybe connect it to that for manuscript
  
- SO MAIN THING, GO BACK AND BLAST THE 'CHLOROPLAST' SEQUENCE AND SEE WHAT THIS IS: play around with the blastn and refseq databases
  - go back to the refseqs file and look for the raw nucleotide sequence for g_chloroplast and for the NA
  - g_chloroplast may be cyanobacteria so maybe go back and check that
  - if we don't find anything for the chloroplast, then we should describe that it is the genus phylum
  - CHANGE THE G_CHLOROPLAST SO IT'S INTO CYANOBACTERIA; DO A FIGURE LEGEND TO SHOW IT
