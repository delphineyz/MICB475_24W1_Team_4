## Agenda
- comments and edits on our research proposal rough draft
- docs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AUAA0RJr9fe_u5RRp7WyGOJfFhPB-yHMRZGim7aQSOw/edit?usp=sharing

- would love some assitance in making the QIME code that we used in class specific to paired-end sequences
- questions about the README.md in our github: what should that look like?
