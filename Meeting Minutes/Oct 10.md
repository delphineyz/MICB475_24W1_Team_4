## Agenda: 
- our research question right now: How does low, medium and high levels of relative humidity affect microbiota diversity and subsequent metabolic pathways in the ISS?
- AIMS:
  1. To assess the effect of different relative humidity levels on alpha and beta diversity of dust-associated microbiomes.
  2. To characterize the changes in specific microbial taxa under different relative humidity  conditions.
  3. To predict the functional potential of microbiomes in response to relative humidity variations using metagenomic approaches.
  4. To compare microbial taxa between constant relative humidity and varying relative humidity.
