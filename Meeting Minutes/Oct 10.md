## Agenda: 
- Discuss our research question and AIMS:
- our research question right now: How does low, medium and high levels of relative humidity affect microbiota diversity and subsequent metabolic pathways in the ISS?
- AIMS:
  1. To assess the effect of different relative humidity levels on alpha and beta diversity of dust-associated microbiomes.
  2. To characterize the changes in specific microbial taxa under different relative humidity  conditions.
  3. To predict the functional potential of microbiomes in response to relative humidity variations using metagenomic approaches.
  4. To compare microbial taxa between constant relative humidity and varying relative humidity.
- how we are thinking of binning our relative humidity: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9691097/
- alternatively, we will bin it ourselves based on percentages such as 50%, 85%-90%, and 100%; similar to this paper: https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-024-01864-3
  
- looking for feedback on the research question and aims

Questions?
- how much/what data wrangling should we do with our dataset for the research proposal
- what should we be doing in the next week and guidance on research proposal

## Meeting Minutes:
- Points from Hans:
- Assignment 5: think everyone did well with the code, but for the future we want to include all input files, all output files, and all scripts | add more details in the comments before the line of code
