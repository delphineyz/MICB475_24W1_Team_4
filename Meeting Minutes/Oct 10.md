## Agenda: 
- Discuss our research question and AIMS:
- our research question right now: How does low, medium and high levels of relative humidity affect microbiota diversity and subsequent metabolic pathways in the ISS?
- AIMS:
  1. To assess the effect of different relative humidity levels on alpha and beta diversity of dust-associated microbiomes.
  2. To characterize the changes in specific microbial taxa under different relative humidity  conditions.
  3. To predict the functional potential of microbiomes in response to relative humidity variations using metagenomic approaches.
  4. To compare microbial taxa between constant relative humidity and varying relative humidity.
- how we are thinking of binning our relative humidity: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9691097/
- alternatively, we will bin it ourselves based on percentages such as 50%, 85%-90%, and 100%; similar to this paper: https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-024-01864-3
  
- looking for feedback on the research question and aims

Questions?
- how much/what data wrangling should we do with our dataset for the research proposal
- what should we be doing in the next week and guidance on research proposal

## Meeting Minutes:
- Points from Hans:
  - Assignment 5: think everyone did well with the code, but for the future we want to include all input files, all output files, and all scripts | add more details in the comments before the line of code
  - Proposal is due on October 20th, so get it started soon
    - For the GANTT chart, pick either 7 or 10 days for timeline resolution
    - Everyone should work on the Introduction and Background for the proposal, so that we all understand what's going on
- From our updates:
  -  different variables we would focus on: different humidity levels
  -  Hans' comment: binning the numerical into the categorical variables
  -  Jagroop went over our AIMS
    - 4th AIM: comparing the constant and variable humidity
      - Hans' comments: how would this answer our research question?
        -   f
