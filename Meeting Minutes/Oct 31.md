## Agenda
- go over proposal feedback and plan next steps
  - comment from marker:  "I am a bit concerned about such a high sample loss after rarefaction. It may be a good thing to discuss with your mentoring TA."
  - potentially think more about how we are doing the filtering; currently, are we only doing taxanomic filtering? Video in module 6 talks more about it and how, for example, if sample collection is different we could maybe filter differently; even though it isn't in our case, it'd be something to keep in mind.
  - also mentioned that we should avoid using ANCOM, even though we had Hans' support
  - TA commented that a T-test is wrong for AIM1 because our data is probably non-parametric, thus should we should consider Wilcoxon/Mann-Whiteney test right? (won't use Kruskall-wallis because we're comparing two groups, constant and then varying RH)
  - should we do our alpha/beta diversity tests on QIME, or on R?
  - random notes
    - Jagroop, did you do feature-based filtering where you got rid of rare ASVs, maybe that is why we lost a lot of samples?   
- *for Hans: we shall add more to the agenda this evening!
