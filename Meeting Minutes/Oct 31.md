## Agenda
- go over proposal feedback and plan next steps
  - comment from marker:  "I am a bit concerned about such a high sample loss after rarefaction. It may be a good thing to discuss with your mentoring TA."
  - also mentioned that we should avoid using ANCOM, even though we had Hans' support
 
  - random notes
    - Jagroop, did you do feature-based filtering where you got rid of rare ASVs, maybe that is why we lost a lot of samples?   
- *for Hans: we shall add more to the agenda this evening!
